NewBox
======

This sample shows you how to:
* Use `UIDocumentMenuViewController` and `UIDocumentMenuViewController`.
* Create Document Provider extensions: DocumentPickerViewController Extension and FileProvider Extension.
* Work with built-in iCloud storage provider.
 

We strongly recommend you to read the following guides before you start:
* [App Extension Programming Guide]
* [Document Picker Programming Guide]

When you run the app you will see two columns. First column shows Document Picker directly and the second shows you Document Picker Menu. Document Picker Menu allows you to select Document Picker and add custom options.

Document Provider extension consists in two parts: Document picker extension and File provider extension. These extensions are presented with the following projects:
* `NBox` – Document picker extension.
* `NBoxFileProvider` – File provider extension.

Setup
-----
You need to setup an Application IDs with App Groups and iCloud. Then you need to generate a provisioning profile linked to the newly created AppID.
To setup AppIDs, App Groups, Provisioning profiles please look at [this introduction]

iOS 8.0 provides a single and built-in iCloud storage provider. The goal of this sample is to add an other storage provider.

To start using the Document Picker and Open/Import from the iCloud storage Provider, you need to create some documents in iCloud iOS 8. The easiest way to do so is to use one of the following apps:
* Pages
* Numbers
* Keynote

You can donwload these apps from the [iOS Dev Center]. Choose iOS 8 tab and download the app's `*.dmg` file.

Also to use Document Picker's Export/Move feature you need to be able to export or move documents to an other app which is compatible with iCloud Drive feature. In order to use that, you need to update your mac to Yosemite. Then you will be able to export documents to Preview or TextEdit apps.

Open/Import documents from iCloud document provider with Document Picker
------------

* Create some documents in iCloud container. For this step you need Pages, Numbers or Keynote.
* Run the NewBox app.
* Choose `Open` or `Import`.
* Choose a file and tap on it. `UIDocumentViewController` will be dismissed.
* Look at the device's console output to see the results (file content).

Export/Move documents to iCloud document provider with Document Picker
------------
* For this step you need mac with Yosemite.
* Run the NewBox app.
* Choose `Export` or `Move`.
* Select a destination (e.g. within `Preview` or `TextEdit` folder) and tap on `Export(Move) to this location`
* Go to `Finder` on your Mac and choose `iCloud Drive`. Choose a folder (e.g. `Preview` or `TextEdit`)
* You will find your file.

Open/Import documents from NBox file provider extension
-------------------------------------------------------
* Run the NewBox app.
* Choose `Open/Import`.
* Enable your extension. Tap on `Locations` then `More ...`. Enable extension. Tap `Done`.
* Choose `Open`/`Import` again. Tap on "Locations" and choose your extension.
* Tap on `Untitled.txt` button. At this point file provider will provide a file for you.
* Look at the console output.

Export/Move document to NBox file provider extension
----------------------------------------------------
* Run the NewBox app.
* Choose Export/Move.
* Enable your extension. Tap on `Locations` then `More ...`. Enable extension. Tap `Done`.
* Choose `Export/Move` again. Tap on `Locations` choose your extension.
* Tap on `Export/Move to this location` button.
* Go to NBox user interface again and you will see the imported file.

Note
