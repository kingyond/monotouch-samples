### NSZombieApocalypse ###

===========================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

The NSZombieApocalypse is a contrived game that exemplifies how to use the UIAccessibility protocol in order to make an app accessible to VoiceOver users.

When the zombie meter is full, the app crashes. This is the expected behavior.

It is also normal that the zombies flicker.
