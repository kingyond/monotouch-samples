watchOS 2 Catalog: Using WatchKit Interface Elements
==================================================
 
Xamarin watchOS 2 Preview
-------------------------

This sample is for use with the [Xamarin watchOS 2 preview](https://blog.xamarin.com/watchos-2-preview-and-updates/). It contains *both* a Watch App and Extension for "watch OS 1" (generally apps build with iOS 8-paired phones in mind) and the new "watch OS 2" preview.

1. Right-click the **WatchApp2** project and select **Set as startup project**
2. The simulator list should change to display 38mm and 42mm watch options. If it doesn't change, restart Xamarin Studio.
3. With a *watch simulator* selected, start debugging.


### Simulator Only

Not that this preview of Xamarin watchOS 2 support only works on the simulator. *You cannot compile for or deploy to devices.*
